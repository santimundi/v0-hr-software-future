diagnoses unless necessary; HR can facilitate privacy-preserving
documentation.

don't fit PTO or sick leave categories. Personal days: - Are requested
through the same system as PTO - Typically do not carry over

location. A holiday calendar is published annually. If business needs
require working on a holiday, managers will coordinate alternative time
off where permitted.
