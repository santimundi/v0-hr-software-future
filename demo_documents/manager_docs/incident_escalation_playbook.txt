Incident Escalation Playbook (Mock)
Owner: Alex Rivera (Engineering Manager)
Classification: Internal

Purpose
-------
This playbook documents how the engineering organization responds to incidents, including severity levels, roles,
communication cadence, stakeholder updates, and post-incident requirements. It is intentionally verbose to simulate
a multi-page manager document for UI upload/testing.

Severity Levels
---------------
Sev-1: Full outage, major data loss risk, security breach indicators.
Sev-2: Partial outage, degraded performance across key systems.
Sev-3: Localized issues, workarounds available.
Sev-4: Minor defects, no immediate impact.

Roles & Responsibilities
------------------------
Incident Commander (IC): Owns coordination, decision-making, and call cadence.
Operations Lead: Executes mitigations, coordinates on-call engineers.
Comms Lead: Drafts updates, manages stakeholder messages.
Scribe: Maintains timeline, captures actions and decisions.
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs): Investigate hypotheses, implement fixes.

First 15 Minutes Checklist
--------------------------
1) Declare incident channel and assign IC.
2) Establish current impact, scope, and customer-facing symptoms.
3) Start a timeline with timestamps for every major action.
4) Freeze risky deployments if warranted.
5) Identify short-term mitigations and owners.
6) Confirm alerting signals and dashboards.

Communication Cadence
---------------------
Sev-1: Update internal stakeholders every 15 minutes; external updates every 30 minutes when applicable.
Sev-2: Update internal stakeholders every 30 minutes; external updates hourly if needed.
Sev-3/4: As-needed; document outcome in incident ticket.

Escalation Triggers
-------------------
- Multiple services impacted
- Repeated failures after rollback
- Security or privacy indicators
- On-call exhaustion or lack of coverage

Postmortem Requirements (Blameless)
-----------------------------------
Hold a postmortem within 5 business days:
- Summary of impact
- Timeline
- Root cause analysis
- Contributing factors
- What went well / what went poorly
- Action items with owners + due dates
