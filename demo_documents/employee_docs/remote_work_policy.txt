## 1. Purpose & Scope

This policy defines how remote and hybrid work operates at **Northstar
Software, Inc.**. It applies to employees in roles eligible for remote
work, subject to manager approval and business needs. Some roles (e.g.,
facilities, certain support functions) may require on-site presence.

Remote work is a work arrangement---not a benefit or entitlement. The
company may modify remote arrangements as team needs change.

## 2. Definitions

-   **Remote work:** Work performed off-site (home or another approved
    location).
-   **Hybrid work:** Combination of on-site and remote work.
-   **Core hours:** Time window when employees should be generally
    available for collaboration (unless otherwise agreed).

## 3. Eligibility

Employees are generally eligible if they: - Have completed probation (or
an equivalent introductory period) - Meet performance and reliability
expectations - Have a role that can be performed effectively off-site -
Maintain an appropriate work environment (see Section 6)

Managers may deny or modify remote schedules based on: - Customer
needs - Security requirements - Team collaboration requirements -
Performance or conduct concerns

## 4. Remote/Hybrid Schedule

### 4.1 Standard Guideline

A common arrangement is up to **3 days per week** remote, with manager
approval. Teams may adopt different schedules.

### 4.2 Core Hours

Employees should be available during core hours such as **10:00--16:00
local time** (team-defined). Work outside core hours may be flexible,
but should not create sustained collaboration gaps.

### 4.3 Location Constraints

Remote work must be performed from an approved location. Employees
must: - Provide an address for emergency and tax compliance purposes
(where required) - Notify HR/manager of changes to primary work
location - Obtain written approval before working from a different
country/state if it impacts tax, payroll, or compliance

## 5. Performance & Communication Expectations

Remote work succeeds when expectations are explicit:

-   **Availability:** Maintain agreed working hours and respond within
    reasonable timeframes.
-   **Meetings:** Join on time, camera use as team norms require, and
    stay engaged.
-   **Documentation:** Prefer written updates in shared channels
    (tickets, docs) over private messages.
-   **Output:** Performance is evaluated on results, not visible
    activity.

Recommended team norms: - Daily async updates (e.g., "what I'm doing
today / blockers") - Calendar hygiene (keep availability updated) -
Meeting discipline (agendas, outcomes, action items)

## 6. Workspace Requirements & Safety

Employees must maintain a safe, professional workspace: - Reliable
internet and phone access (as role requires) - A quiet environment
suitable for calls - A dedicated workspace that protects confidential
information - Ergonomic setup (chair, monitor height, lighting)

Employees should: - Take breaks and maintain healthy work habits -
Report work-related injuries or incidents promptly

## 7. Equipment, IT Support & Expenses

### 7.1 Company-Provided Equipment

Depending on role, the company may provide: - Laptop and accessories -
Security key or MFA device - Standard peripherals (mouse, headset)

All equipment remains company property.

### 7.2 Software and Updates

company-approved software - Not disable endpoint protection
